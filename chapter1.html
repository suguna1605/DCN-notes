A computer network is a system that connects two or more computing devices for transmitting and
sharing information.<br>These devices are connected using physical wires such as fiber optics, but they canalso be wire
less.<br>

                        o Computer network is made up of two main parts:<br>  devices (called
                        nodes) and connections (called links). The links connect the devices
                        to each other<br>

                        o The computers communicate using standard protocols to
                        send/receive data. Computer networks<br> can also include other
                        devices that help in communication (network devices).<br>

                        o The U.S. Advanced Research Projects Agency Network
                        (ARPANET) was the first public packet<br>-switched computer network.<br>

                        o . ARPANET's main use was for academic and research purposes.<br>
<br>
                         Modes of communication<br>

                        1. Simplex Mode – In Simplex mode, the communication is unidirectional, as on a one-way street.<br>
                         Ex: Keyboard and monitors.<br>

                        2. Half-Duplex Mode – In this mode, each station can bo transmit and receive,
                        but not at the same time.<br> Ex: Walkie-talkie<br>
                        

                        3. Full-Duplex Mode – In full-duplex mode, both stations can transmit and receive simultaneously.<br>
                        Ex. Telephones<br>
                        </ol>

                       <ol>
                         1. Internet and World Wide Web :<br> World Wide Web, that offers us various features like access to websites,
                        online services<br> and retrieval of information. we can do search, and access web pages .<br>

                        2. Communication :<br> communication is also easy because we can do email, instant messaging,voice and
                        video calls<br> and video conferencing, which helps us to communicate with each other effectively.<br>

                        3. File Sharing and Data Transfer :<br> This covers file sharing within a business setting, file sharing between
                        personal devices,<br> and downloading/uploading of content from the internet.<br>

                        4. Online gaming :<br>Multiplayer online games use computer networks to link players from all over the world,<br>
                        enabling online competitions and real-time gaming experiences.<br>

                        5. Remote Access and Control :<br> Networks enable users to access and control systems and devices from a
                        distance. This is<br> helpful when accessing home automation systems, managing servers, and providing
                        remote IT support.<br>

                        6. Social media<br>
                        <br>

                        7. Cloud Computing The provision of on-demand access to computing resources and services<br> hosted in
                           distant data centres relies on networks. Some example of cloud computing is software<br> as a service (SaaS),
                           platform as a service (PaaS) and infrastructure as service (IaaS).<br>

                        8. Online Banking and E-Commerce<br>

                           Online banking and e-commerce platforms, where customers conduct financial transactions and <br>make
                           online purchases, require secure computer networks.<br>

                        9. Enterprise Networks<br>

                           In Computer networks, we have some networks that are only used in businesses and organizations <br>so they
                           can store data and share files and resources like printers, scanners, etc.<br>

                                 Structure of the Network basically tells us how do the things work internally. It tells us about the
                                  protocols,<br> the internal workings of an internet system, etc.<br>

                                 A computer network is a structure that makes available to a data processing user at one place some
                                  data processing<br> function or service performed at another place<br>

                                 Network structure refers to a general system or pattern of relationships that can be derived from the
                                  observable<br> behavior of animate and inanimate actors or objects in a given population<br>

                                 Structure is usually understood as the arrangement of parts or elements of some complexity tied
                                  together by relations.<br>

                                 Network structure can be studied and measured with social and dynamic network analysis, which
                                  allows the study of<br> network topology, network behavior, and evolution,<br>

Computer Network Architecture is defined as the physical and logical design of the software, hardware,
protocols, and media of the transmission of data.<br>

The two types of network architectures are used:
o Peer-To-Peer network
o Client/Server network

                                      processing the data.<br>

                                    o Peer-To-Peer network is useful for small environments, usually
                                      up to 10 computers.<br>

                                    o Peer-To-Peer network has no dedicated server.<br>

                                    o Special permissions are assigned to each computer for sharing
                                      the resources, but this can lead to a problem <br>if the computer
                                      with the resource is down.<br>

                 Telnet: Telnet enables one computer to connect to the local computer.<br>

                 SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol): SNMP monitors and manages network devices
                  connected over an IP.<br>

                 FTP (File Transfer Protocol): FTP protocol transfers files between computers.<br>

            <h4>2.The Transport Layer.</h4>
            <p>
                The transport layer is the third layer of the TCP/IP model, a framework that defines how devices
                communicate over a network. It sits above the internet layer and the application layer.<br>

                The transport layer uses two main protocols to achieve these goals:<br>
                </p>
                <li>
                    <ol>
                         TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that provides reliable
                          data delivery. It establishes a connection between devices and ensures that all data is delivered
                          accurately. If any data is lost or corrupted during transmission, TCP will request that the sender
                          retransmit the lost or corrupted data.<br>

                         UDP (User Datagram Protocol): UDP is a connectionless protocol that does not guarantee data
                          delivery. It is used for real-time applications, such as online gaming and VoIP, where speed is more
                          important than reliability.<br>

                    </ol>
                    <h4>3.The Internet Layer</h4>
                    <p>
                        It is responsible for providing logical addressing and routing services to ensure that data packets are
                        delivered from their source to their destination over a network.<br>
                        Examples of Internet layer protocols include:<br>
                    </p>
                    <li>
                        <ol>
                             Internet Protocol (IP): IP is the primary protocol of the Internet layer and is responsible for providing
                              logical addressing and routing services to ensure that data packets are delivered from their source to
                              their destination over a network.<br>

                             Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP): ICMP reports errors and sends diagnostic information in
                              the Internet Protocol (IP). It sends error messages, such as "destination unreachable" or "time
                              exceeded," when a device cannot deliver a data packet to its intended destination.<br>

                             Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6): IPv6 is the latest version of the Internet Protocol and is designed to
                              address the limitations of the previous version, IPv4. It provides a much larger address space, improved
                              security, and better support for mobile devices and Internet of Things (IoT) applications.<br>

                        </ol>
                        <h4>4.Network Access Layer</h4>
                        <li>
                            <ol>
                                 It is a group of applications requiring network communications. This layer is responsible for
                                  generating the data and requesting connections.<br>

                                 It acts on behalf of the sender and the Network Access layer on the behalf of the receiver.<br>

                                 The packet’s network protocol type, in this case, TCP/IP, is identified by network access layer.<br>

                                 Error prevention and “framing” are also provided by this layer. Point-to-Point Protocol
                                  (PPP) framing and Ethernet IEEE 802.2 framing are two examples of data-link layer protocols.<br>
