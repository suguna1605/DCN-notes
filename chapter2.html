            <h2><center> PHYSICAL LAYER  </center></h2>
            <div class="chapter 02 notes">
 <p> The physical Layer is the bottom-most layer in the Open System Interconnection (OSI) Model which is a
      physical and electrical representation of the system.<br>
     It consists of various network components such as power plugs, connectors, receivers, cable types, etc. The
      physical layer sends data bits from one device(s) (like a computer) to another device(s).<br>
     The physical Layer defines the types of encoding (that is how the 0’s and 1’s are encoded in a signal).<br>
     The physical Layer is responsible for the communication of the unstructured raw data streams over a physical
      medium.<br
     </p>
     <h2><center>TRANSMISSION MEDIA</center></h2>
<p> A transmission medium is a physical path between the transmitter and the receiver i.e.<br>
    it is the channel through which data is sent from one place to another.<br>
    These pathways can be wired or wireless.<br>
    The choice of medium depends on factors like distance, speed, and interference<br>
</p>
<h3>1. Guided Media</h3> 
<p>  Guided Media is also referred to as Wired or Bounded transmission media. Signals being transmitted
      are directed and confined in a narrow pathway by using physical links.<br>
     It provides us with features like higher speeds, and better security and is used preferably for
      comparatively shorter distances.<br>
     A signal traveling along any such media is directed and contained by the physical limits of the medium.<br>
</p>
<h4>There are 3 major types of Guided Media</h4>
<h3> Twisted Pair Cable</h3>
<p>
     These are a type of guided media.<br>
     It was invented by Alexander Graham Bell.<br>
     Twisted pair cables have two conductors that are generally made up of copper and each
      conductor has insulation.<br>
     These two conductors are twisted together, thus giving the name twisted pair cables.<br>

</p>
<h4>Twisted Pair is of two types:</h4>
<h3> Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP):</h3>
<p>
    UTP consists of two insulated copper wires twisted around one
another. This type of cable has the ability to block interference and does not depend on a physical shield
for this purpose. It is used for telephonic applications.<br>
</p>
<h4>Advantages of Unshielded Twisted Pair</h4>
<p>
     Least expensive<br>
     Easy to install<br>
     High-speed capacity<br>
</p>
<h4>Disadvantages of Unshielded Twisted Pair</h4>
<p>
     Susceptible to external interference<br>
     Lower capacity and performance in comparison
      to STP<br>
     Short distance transmission due to attenuation<br>
</p>
<h3>Shielded Twisted Pair (STP):</h3>
<p>
    This type of cableconsists of a special jacket (a copper braid covering or a
    foil shield) to block external interference. It is used in
    fast-data-rate Ethernet and in voice and data channels
    of telephone lines.<br>
</p>
<h4>Advantages of Shielded Twisted Pair</h4>
<p>
     Better performance at a higher data rate in
      comparison to UTP<br>
     Eliminates crosstal<br>
     Comparatively faster<br>
</p>
<h4>Disadvantages of Shielded Twisted Pair</h4>
<p>
   Comparatively difficult to install and manufacture<br>
   More expensive<br>
   Bulky<br>
  <br>
   Twisted-Pair Cables Are Used In Many Applications In Networking And Communication,
    For Example, In Telephone Lines, Digital Subscriber Line And Local Area Networks.<br>
</p>
<h3>Coaxial Cable</h3>
<p>
   Coaxial Cable is a type of guided media made of Plastics, and copper wires which transmit the signal in
    electrical form rather than light form. Coaxial cable is also known as coax.<br>
   The core copper conductor is used for the transmission of signals and the insulator is used to provide
    insulation to the copper conductor the insulator is surrounded by a braided metal conductor which
    helps to prevent the interference of electrical signals and prevent cross talk.<br>
   This entire setup is again covered with a protective plastic layer to provide extra safety to the cable.<br>
</p>
<h4>Structure of Coaxial Cable</h4>
<p>
   Copper conductor: <br>A central conductor, which consists of copper. The conductor is the point at
    which data is transmitted.<br>
   Insulator: <br> Dielectric plastic insulation
    around the copper conductor. it is
    used to maintain the spacing between
    the center conductor and shield.<br>
   Braided mesh:<br> A braided mesh of
    copper helps to shield
    from electromagnetic interference,
    The braid provides a barrier against
    EMI moving into and out of the coaxial
    cable.<br>
   Protective plastic layer:<br> An external polymer layer, which has a plastic coating. It is used to
    protect internal layers from damage.<br>
</p>
<h4>Advantages of Coaxial Cable</h4>
<p>
   Coaxial cables support high bandwidth.<br>
   It is easy to install coaxial cables.<br>
   Coaxial cables have better cut-through resistance so they are more reliable and durable.<br>
   Less affected by noise or cross-talk or electromagnetic inference.<br>
   Coaxial cables support multiple channels<br>

</p>
<h4>Disadvantages of Coaxial Cable</h4>
<p>
   Coaxial cables are expensive.<br>
   The coaxial cable must be grounded in order to prevent any crosstalk.<br>
   As a Coaxial cable has multiple layers it is very bulky.<br>
   There is a chance of breaking the coaxial cable and attaching a “t-joint” by hackers, this
    compromises the security of the data.<br>
</p>
<h3>Fiber Optics</h3>
<p>
   Fiber optics refers to the technology and method of transmitting information as light pulses
    along a glass or plastic strand or fiber.<br>
   Fiber optic cables are used for long-distance and high-performance data networking.<br>
   They are capable of transmitting data over longer distances and at higher bandwidths (dat
    rates) than electrical cables, making them a critical component in modern
    telecommunications, internet, and computer networking<br>
</p>
<h4>Main Elements of Fiber Optics</h4>
<p>
   Core:<br> It is the central tube of very thin size
    made of optically transparent dielectric medium
    and carries the light transmitter to receiver and
    the core diameter may vary from about 5um to
    100 um.<br>
   Cladding:<br> It is an outer optical material
    surrounding the core having a reflecting index
    lower than the core and cladding helps to keep
    the light within the core throughout the
    phenomena of total internal reflection.<br>
   Buffer Coating:<br> It is a plastic coating that protects the fiber made of silicon rubber. The typical
    diameter of the fiber after the coating is 250-300 um.<br>
</p>
<h4>Types of Fiber Optics</h4>
<p>
   Based on the Material Used<br>
   Plastic Optical Fibres:<br>       For transmission of light, polymethylmethacrylate is used as core
    material<br>
   Glass Fibres:<br>  These are extremely fine glass fibers, the core and cladding of the optical fiber
    is made of plastic.<br>

<br>
   Based on the Number of Modes<br>
   Single-mode fiber: <br>In single-mode fiber, only one type of ray of light can propagate through the
    fiber.<br>
   Multi-mode fiber:<br> Multimode fiber allows many modes for the light rays traveling through it.<br>

</p>
<h4>Advantages of Fiber Optics</h4>
<p>
   Fiber Optics supports bandwidth with higher capacities.<br>
   Electromagnetic Interference is very little with Fiber Optics.<br>
   Fiber Optics are stronger and lighter than copper cables.<br>
   Very little Maintenance is required in Optical Fiber<br>
</p>
<h4>Disadvantages of Fiber Optics</h4>
<p>
   Fiber Optics is more costly than Copper Wire.<br>
   Huge manual work is required to install new cables.<br>
   Some optical fibers like glass fiber require more protection.<br>
   Fiber Optics are more fragile i.e., can be easily broken, or signals can be lost easily.<br>
</p>
<h2><center>UNGUIDED MEDIA</center></h3>

<p>
  o An unguided transmission transmits the electromagnetic waves without using any physical
    medium. Therefore it is also known as wireless transmission.<br>
  o In unguided media, air is the media through which the electromagnetic energy can flow easily.<br>
</p>
<h3>Radio waves</h3>
<p>
  o Radio waves are the electromagnetic waves that are transmitted in all the directions of free space.<br>
  o Radio waves are omnidirectional, i.e., the signals are propagated in all the directions.<br>
  o The range in frequencies of radio waves is from 3Khz to 1 khz.<br>
  o In the case of radio waves, the sending and receiving antenna are not aligned, i.e., the wave sent
    by the sending antenna can be received by any receiving antenna.<br>
  o An example of the radio wave is FM radio.<br>

</p>
<h4>Applications Of Radio waves:</h4>
<p>
  o A Radio wave is useful for multicasting when there is one sender and many receivers.<br>
  o An FM radio, television, cordless phones are examples of a radio wave<br>
  
</p>
<h4>Advantages Of Radio transmission:</h4>
<p>
  o Radio transmission is mainly used for wide area networks and mobile cellular phones.<br>
  o Radio waves cover a large area, and they can penetrate the walls.<br>
  o Radio transmission provides a higher transmission rate.<br>
</p>
<h3>Microwaves</h3>
<p>
  o Electromagnetic waves having frequencies between 1 and 300 GHz are called microwaves.<br>
  o Microwaves are unidirectional. The sending and receiving antennas need to be aligned.<br>
  o The unidirectional property has an obvious advantage.<br>
  o A pair of antennas can be aligned without interfering with another pair of aligned antennas.<br>
</p>
<h3><center>There are two types of microwaves:</center></h3>
<h4>1. Terrestrial Microwave</h4>
<p>
  Terrestrial Microwave are microwaves that transmits the beam of a radio signal from one ground
  based antenna to another ground based antenna.<br>
</p>
<h4>Advantages</h4>
<p>
   Terrestrial microwave is cheaper than using cables for communication.<br>
   Terrestrial microwave does not require land for installation so it is free from taking any land
    space.<br>
   Communication over oceans is achieved by using microwave<br>
</p>
<h4>2. Satellite Microwave Communication</h4>
<p>
 A satellite is a object that revolve around the earth. A satellite microwave is a type of
 communication technology that uses microwave radio waves to transmit data between
 a ground-based station and an orbiting satellite<br>
</p>
<h4>Advantages</h4>
<p>
   Wide Coverage:<br> Satellites can cover large areas of the Earth, reaching remote and rural
    locations where other communication methods might not be available.<br> 
   Long Distance Communication:<br>  They allow for communication over very long distances,
    including international and intercontinental connections, without the need for physical
    infrastructure on the ground.<br>
   Broadcast Capabilities: <br>Satellites can efficiently broadcast information to a large number of
    receivers simultaneously, making them ideal for television and radio transmissions<br>
</p>
<h3>Infrared</h3>
<p>
  o An infrared transmission is a wireless technology used for communication over short ranges.<br>
  o The frequency of the infrared in the range from 300 GHz to 400 THz.<br>
  o It is used for short-range communication such as data transfer between two cell phones, TV
    remote operation, data transfer between a computer and cell phone resides in the same closed
    area<br>
</p>
<h4>Characteristics Of Infrared:</h4>
<p>
  o It supports high bandwidth, and hence the data rate will be very high.<br>
  o Infrared waves cannot penetrate the walls. Therefore, the infrared communication in one room
    cannot be interrupted by the nearby rooms.<br>
  o An infrared communication provides better security with minimum interference.<br>
  o Infrared communication is unreliable outside the building because the sun rays will interfere with
    the infrared waves.<br>
<h4>Application of Infrared Signals</h4>
<p>
  Below mentioned are the applications of Infrared Signals<br>
   Infrared signals can be used for short-range communication in a closed area using line-of-sight
    propagation.<br>
   Infrared technology is widely used in security systems, including motion detectors
    and infrared cameras.<br>
   Infrared sensors are employed in various automotive applications, such as night vision systems
    and collision avoidance systems.<br>
   Infrared technology is found in many consumer electronic devices, including remote controls
    for televisions, air conditioners, and other appliances<br>

<h2><center>SWITCHING</center></h2>
<p>
   Switching is the process of transferring data packets from one device to another in a
    network, or from one network to another, using specific devices called switches.<br>
   The switch knows which devices are connected to it and can send data directly between them.
    If the data needs to go to another network, the switch sends it to a router, which forwards it to
    the correct destination.<br>
   It helps multiple devices share a network without their data interfering with each other.<br>
   Switching technique is used to connect the systems for making one-to-one communication<br>
</p>
<h4>There are three types of switching methods:</h4>
<p>
   Message Switching<br>
   Circuit Switching<br>
   Packet Switching<br>
</p>
<h2><center>Message Switching</center></h2>
<P>
  o Message Switching is a switching technique in which a message is transferred as a complete unit
    and routed through intermediate nodes at which it is stored and forwarded.<br>
  o In Message Switching technique, there is no establishment of a dedicated path between the
    sender and receiver.<br>
  o The destination address is appended to the message. Message Switching provides a dynamic
    routing as the message is routed through the intermediate nodes based on the information
    available in the message.<br>
  o Message switches are programmed in such a way so that they can provide the most efficient
    routes.<br>
  o Each and every node stores the entire message and then forward it to the next node. This type of
    network is known as store and forward network.<br>
  o Message switching treats each message as an independent entity<br>
